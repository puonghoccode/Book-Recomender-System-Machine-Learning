# üìö Book Recommender System

The Book Recommender System project is developed with the goal of applying Machine Learning techniques to build an intelligent book recommendation system.

The system supports three main recommendation methods:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Item-based Collaborative Filtering ‚Äî recommends books based on user rating behavior.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Content-based Filtering ‚Äî recommends books based on book content (title + author).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering-based Recommendation ‚Äî recommends books from similar user or item clusters.

Interface Deployment: The application interface is built with Streamlit, allowing users to easily select a recommendation method and receive book suggestions.
